# E-Commerce Store Project

Welcome to our E-Commerce Store project, a part of the requirements for the CMM004 Software Project Engineering course in the Master of Science program at Robert Gordon University. This project showcases an e-commerce website built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used the Scrum framework for project management to effectively organize and achieve our project objectives.

## Project Overview

In this project, we designed and developed a fully functional e-commerce store that allows users to browse, search, and purchase products. The website includes features like user authentication, product listings, shopping cart, order processing, and more. Our goal was to create a practical e-commerce platform for both buyers and sellers.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project locally, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with PHP support.
- MySQL database server for storing product and user data.
- A modern web browser to access the e-commerce store.

## Project Features

Our e-commerce store project includes the following features:

- User registration and authentication.
- Product listings with detailed descriptions and images.
- Shopping cart for adding/removing products.
- Checkout and order processing.
- Admin panel for product and user management.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.php`: The homepage and product listings.
- `product.php`: Individual product details.
- `cart.php`: Shopping cart page.
- `checkout.php`: Checkout and order processing.
- `admin/`: Admin panel for product and user management.
- `css/`: Stylesheets for the website.
- `js/`: JavaScript files.
- `images/`: Product images.
- `includes/`: PHP scripts and utility functions.

## Scrum Framework

We used the Scrum framework to manage this project effectively. The Scrum approach allowed us to work in iterative sprints, prioritize tasks, and maintain transparency in project progress. Key Scrum artifacts and events, including Product Backlog, Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, were an integral part of our project management.
